Create an html page with a button and an empty list (<ul>)
When the button is clicked add a new item to the list and attach a number to the list item.
The list item number should start at zero and increase by one each time.
For example, if the button is clicked 3 times you should see three list items:
* Item 0
* Item 1
* Item 2
